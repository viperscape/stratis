#### What

This sub project is entirely for testing FFI by itself, see the basic unit tests for examples on how to use the FFI from a csharp project such as with scripts in Unity3d

#### Unity3d

The Assets folder and contents should be copied to your unity project folder, if your unity project is already loaded, you may have to close it as unity loads and locks the dll file (wtf).
